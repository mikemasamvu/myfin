The home page will be the `Dashboard` were the user will be able to see the summary of their financial data. On the left there will be a vertical navigation bar that will allow the user to navigate to other webpages. In the middle there will be sum of all incomes earned as `Total Income`, sum of all expenses incurred as `Total Expenses` and the balance of the two as `Total Balance`. Below that is the `Recent Transactions` table were the user can see the 5 most recent transactions. If the user clicks the `Show All` link, they will be redirected to another page where all the transaction history will be shown. On the right section there will be a section where the user can see count of the number of transactions were the user earn over $300 as `Earn Over $300` and were they spend over $300 as `Spend Over $300`. Below that is the `Add Transaction` button which allows the user to add more transactions.
